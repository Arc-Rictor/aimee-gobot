# Gobot — Always-On AI Telegram Agent

An always-on Telegram agent powered by Claude with multi-agent routing, proactive check-ins, persistent memory, voice calls, and morning briefings. Supports three deployment modes: local desktop, cloud VPS, or hybrid (recommended).

## What It Does

```
                          ┌── Local (Claude Code CLI + subscription)
You ──▶ Telegram ──▶ Bot ─┤
                          └── VPS  (Anthropic API + API key)
                                │
                                ├── Same code, same features everywhere:
                                │   MCP Servers, Skills, Hooks, CLAUDE.md
                                │
                                └── Convex or Supabase (shared memory, goals, history)
```

- **Relay**: Send messages on Telegram, get Claude responses back (and connect from Google Chat, Microsoft Teams, Discord, WhatsApp, Slack, and more)
- **Multi-Agent**: Route messages to specialized agents via Telegram forum topics
- **Multi-Bot Identities**: Each agent can have its own Telegram bot for visual separation
- **Board Meetings**: `/board` command triggers multi-agent discussion with synthesis
- **Cross-Agent**: Agents consult each other mid-conversation automatically
- **Memory**: Persistent facts, goals, and conversation history via Convex or Supabase (your choice)
- **Image Storage**: Photos stored persistently with AI-generated descriptions, tags, and semantic search
- **Smart Routing**: Messages auto-classified by complexity — Haiku (fast), Sonnet (medium), Opus (powerful)
- **Streaming Progress**: Complex tasks show real-time tool usage and progress updates in Telegram
- **Call-to-Task**: Phone calls auto-detect actionable tasks and execute them with live progress updates
- **Proactive**: Smart check-ins that know when to reach out (and when not to)
- **Briefings**: Daily morning summary with pluggable data sources (goals, calendar, email, news, tasks)
- **Voice**: Text-to-speech replies, voice transcription, and phone calls
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Claude asks for confirmation via inline buttons before taking actions
- **Hybrid Mode**: VPS catches messages 24/7, forwards to your local machine when it's awake
- **Auto-Deploy**: Push to GitHub, VPS pulls and restarts automatically

## What's New

### v2.11.0 — Feedback Loop (Adaptive Interaction Scoring)
GoBot scores your interactions and generates patterns that feed back into the system prompt. Learns which areas it handles well and where it needs more care. Run `bun run feedback` daily or `bun run feedback --analyze` for weekly trends.

### v2.10.0 — MCPManager (Model-Agnostic MCP Tools)
When Claude is rate-limited and GoBot falls back to OpenRouter/Ollama, MCP tools now come along for the ride. MCPManager boots your MCP servers at startup and provides tools to any model.

### v2.8.0 — Convex Migration + Database Choice
**Convex is now the primary database backend.** One-command setup, auto-managed TypeScript schema, built-in vector search and file storage. Supabase remains fully supported as a first-class alternative — choose whichever fits your workflow during Phase 2 setup. All "legacy" and "deprecation" language removed: both backends are equal citizens.

### v2.7.0 — Resilient API Fallback + Cost-Optimized Routing
**Automatic Anthropic → OpenRouter failover.** If Anthropic API goes down (credit depletion, rate limits, outages), all API calls seamlessly route through OpenRouter using the same Anthropic SDK — zero format conversion, zero disruption. Re-checks Anthropic every 15 minutes. Fully optional: works without `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, errors propagate normally.

**Cost-optimized model routing.** Default model tier changed from Sonnet to Haiku. Most messages (greetings, questions, status checks) now route to Haiku (~$0.003/msg) instead of Sonnet (~$0.15/msg). Sonnet activates for tool-requiring tasks, Opus for complex analysis. Estimated **~42% cost reduction** with no quality loss for simple messages.

### v2.6.1 — Universal Fallback (OpenRouter/Ollama everywhere)
Fallback to OpenRouter and Ollama now works on **all modes** (local, VPS, hybrid). Previously only local had fallback — VPS returned generic errors when Anthropic API failed. Also catches Claude Pro/Max subscription limits (was silently passing them through as responses).

### v2.6.0 — Multi-Bot Agent Identities + Board Meetings
Each agent can now have its own Telegram bot — messages from Research, Finance, Content etc. appear from separate bot accounts. New `/board` command triggers a full multi-agent discussion on any topic. Agents can consult each other mid-conversation. All optional, fully backward compatible.

### v2.5.3 — ZIP-to-Git Upgrade
`bun run upgrade` connects ZIP downloads to the official repo. Future updates are just `git pull`.

### v2.5.0 — Reliability & VPS Hardening
Fixed 6 production bugs (voice context, dedup, intent detection). Added VPS hardening docs and raised default API budget to $15.

### v2.3.0 — Call-to-Task Auto-Execution
Phone calls auto-detect actionable tasks and execute them with live progress updates.

### v2.1.0 — Smart Routing + Streaming Progress
Messages auto-classified by complexity (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus). Complex tasks show real-time progress.

### v2.0.0 — VPS Gateway + Hybrid Mode
Always-on VPS processing with Anthropic API, hybrid forwarding, human-in-the-loop, auto-deploy.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

## Deployment Modes

| Mode | How It Works | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Local** | Runs on your machine using Claude Code CLI | Claude Pro subscription to get started ($20/mo), Max for full power ($100-200/mo) |
| **VPS** (24/7) | Runs on a cloud server using Anthropic API | VPS (~$5/mo) + API costs vary by usage and model selection |
| **Hybrid** (recommended) | VPS always on, forwards to local when your machine is awake | VPS + API costs + subscription |

### Same Code, Full Power — Everywhere

Claude Code CLI works with an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. When set, it uses the Anthropic API (pay-per-token). Without it, Claude Code uses your subscription authentication. Both modes give you **all** Claude Code features: MCP servers, skills, hooks, CLAUDE.md, built-in tools.

This means: clone the repo on your VPS, install Claude Code, set your API key, and run `bun run start`. Same experience as your laptop. One codebase everywhere.

### Why Hybrid?

Your laptop sleeps. Your VPS doesn't. With hybrid mode:
- Messages are always processed, even at 3am
- When your local machine is awake, it handles everything via your Claude Code CLI (subscription)
- When it sleeps, VPS takes over with API key (pay-per-token)
- Both have full Claude Code power — MCP servers, skills, hooks, everything

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** runtime (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`)
  - After installing, restart your terminal or run: `export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun" && export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"`
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)** CLI installed and authenticated
- **Windows/Linux only**: [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) for daemon services (`npm install -g pm2`)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo (recommended — enables future updates via git pull)
git clone https://github.com/autonomee/gobot.git
cd gobot

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Open with Claude Code — it reads CLAUDE.md and guides you through setup
claude
```

### Downloaded as ZIP?

If you downloaded the ZIP instead of cloning, your bot works fine — but you can't pull updates. Fix it with one command:

```bash
bun run upgrade
```

This connects your existing install to the official repo without touching your `.env`, profile, or any config. Future updates are then just `git pull origin master`.

Claude Code reads the `CLAUDE.md` file and walks you through a guided conversation to:

1. Create a Telegram bot via BotFather
2. Choose and set up your database (Convex or Supabase)
3. Personalize your profile and agents
4. Customize agents + optional multi-bot identities and `/board` meetings
5. Test the bot
6. Configure always-on services
7. Set up optional integrations (voice, fallback LLMs)
8. Deploy to VPS (optional)
